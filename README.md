Bootstraps your form component with low-level validation feat.

## Importat Note

**Project dropped**.

This **was** a work-in-progress. However, I am stopping this project because starting `v0.13`, [**React** seems to be going away from mixins](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/10/react-v0.13.html); and I couldn't think a good API for this project that wouldn't be boilerplatey or annoying.
